  {
    q: "How much notice do you need?",
    a: "Please allow two weeks for a custom cake and at least three days for cupcakes, loaves, pastries and drinks. A rush custom cake under 48 hours may be available when the rush add-on is selected; the date is not held until Wendy confirms it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do I collect my order?",
    a: "Pickup is in Etobicoke, Toronto. The exact address is sent once your date and payment are confirmed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you deliver?",
    a: "Yes. Delivery is $30 in Etobicoke and $35 across the configured Greater Toronto Area postal zones. Enter your postal code at checkout to confirm that your address is covered before you pay.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I pay and hold my date?",
    a: "Everyday items are paid in full. Custom cakes require the deposit shown when ordering, with the balance due before pickup or delivery. A booking is held only after the payment is confirmed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are custom cake prices worked out?",
    a: "Choose the cake size and layer count, then add each design detail you want. Buttercream custom cakes have a $130 minimum and fondant cakes have a $280 minimum. Every tier is a separate full three-layer cake, and the complete total is shown before checkout.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you make fondant figures or sculpted models?",
    a: "No. Fondant covering, letters and small flat details are available, but sculpted figures and models are not offered.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I know about allergies?",
    a: "Everything is baked in one kitchen that handles wheat, dairy, egg and nuts, so cross-contact cannot be ruled out. Add allergy details at checkout and Wendy will confirm whether the order can be made safely.",
